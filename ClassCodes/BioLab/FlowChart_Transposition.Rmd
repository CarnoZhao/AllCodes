| What | Why |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------:|
| Resuspend doner cells by vortexing | mix with nutrient broth |
| | |
| Vortex recipient briefly | |
| | |
| Put 500$\mu L$ doner and $500\mu L$ recipient in mating tube and vortexing briefly | mate two strains |
| | |
| Incubate in $37^{\circ}\text{C}$ for 60 min (with balance) | start mating |
| | |
| Label information on the plate (name, day, medium, solution, dilution) | |
| | |
| Add $900\mu L$ saline to 7 tube labeled with $10^{-1} \sim 10^{-7}$ | prepare to dilute |
| | |
| Add $100\mu L$ recipient to $10^{-1}$, vortex | dilute |
| | |
| Repeat until $10 ^ {-7}$ | |
| | |
| Put $100\mu L$ last three tube onto nutrient agar plates and spread in circular fasion | control recipient group (without mating) |
| | |
| Put $100\mu L 10 ^0$ | |
